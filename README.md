#Project Proposal

#The project focuses on the New York Airbnb Market. 
#The chosen datasetâ€™s have been extracted from three different sources of data: Personal Information of Airbnb hosts, Cost of Properties per Area and Room type. The data transformation process will be performed using Jupyter Notebook, and then be loaded into a PostgreSQL database preparing the data for further analysis to be performed.
