## Project Proposal

The project focuses on the New York Airbnb Market. 
The chosen datasetâ€™s have been extracted from three different sources of data: Personal Information of Airbnb hosts, Cost of Properties per Area and Room type. The data transformation process will be performed using Jupyter Notebook, and then be loaded into a PostgreSQL database preparing the data for further analysis to be performed.

The goal of this project is to produce a dataset which can utilised in further research by data analysts, who may be exploring the idea of investing in Airbnb properties in New York and the effects
 Specific areas of application for a data analyst could include:

What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
How many adverts are for private rooms?
How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?
