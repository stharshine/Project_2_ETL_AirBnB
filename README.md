## Project Proposal

The project focuses on the New York City Airbnb Market. 
The chosen datasetâ€™s have been extracted from three different sources of data: Personal Information of Airbnb hosts, Cost of Properties per Area and Room type. The data transformation process will be performed using Jupyter Notebook, and then be loaded into a PostgreSQL database preparing the data for further analysis to be performed.


## Goal of the ETL

The goal of this project is to produce a dataset which can utilised in further research by data analysts, who may be exploring the idea of investing in Airbnb properties in New York and the possible financial gains from each type of property (private room or entrire apartment).

Specific areas of application for a data analyst could include:
- Identifying the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in New York City
- Identifying the cost of a private room compared to the cost of an entire apartment, and therefore the financial gain. 
- Identifying the most luxurius and valuable boroughs within the City and the average difference in price between them.


## Sources of Data
Our dataset contains two CSV files and one Excel file are available from www.kaggle.com.
All files are located in the [Resources Folder](https://github.com/stharshine/bootcamp_project_2/tree/main/Resources) :
